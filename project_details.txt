Feature Engineering
1.	Data is clean. There are no missing values. No null, NA, or empty string found in the data
2.	Few of the variables are in numeric and string. We converted required columns into categorical/factor type
3.	We noticed that IsCanceled data is not imbalance otherwise we could have handled it by some sampling techniques
4.	Checking for outliers: [Need to check with the professor regarding how to remove outliers]
5.	Need to figure out the correlation of different variables or scatterplot to find
6.	When we plot the histograms, most of them are right-skewed. Should we do a transformation to make it normal distribution?
7.	We will be doing association rules for finding the patterns in the data w.r.t is canceled = 1
8.	Multi-colinearity detection and removal
9.	Need to run a different logistic regression with different x-variables and find optimized explanatory variable combination based on adjusted R-Square
